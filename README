My first asynchronous non-blocking nodeJS application.

It's non-blocking because it's going to be able to do other things while it's waiting for some long running I/O process.

This app interacts with real time weather APIs. For this reason ir requires asynchronous HTTP Requests.

Dark Sky Net: weather api
-------------

web: https://darksky.net/dev
Need to Log In with an account.

When access to your account will see a key like this:
bf8714f35....

With that key you will be able to make 1000 requests every single day.

API call example:
-----------------
https://api.darksky.net/forecast/bf8714f35..../37.8267,-122.4233

For coordinates locations (geocoding API) we use Map Box:
https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/#geocoding

geocode and forecast are two I/O operations that are operating independently of the other...with callback chaining pattern we are going to be able to do one thing, the the next (to geocode and then address).
